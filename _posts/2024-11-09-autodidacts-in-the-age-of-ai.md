The biggest impact that AI has had on me is that it's changed how I learn.

Like most programmers, I started out by getting a Computer Science degree. I learned the basics of programming, algorithms, data structures, and computer science theory.

However, I've always been an autodidact and admittantly, towards the end of my degree, I stopped attending classes and focusing instead on building things, only showing up to class for the final exam.

When I had questions, I would go to sites like StackOverflow. At some point, I even started writing my own questions and answers on there. This has been an important resource for me over the years in my professional journey as a developer.

There were some issues with StackOverflow though. One was that you couldn't ask questions of the people who were answering. And they would often get annoyed if you asked them a question that had already been answered somewhere else on the site.

Probably this was for good reason because most questions weren't well thought out and were duplicates of other questions. But, this made it so that the default response was that you were asking a dumb question.

StackOverflow tried to address this by adding features such as a reputation system but anyone who didn't have a high reputation or who was new to the site often had to overcome a lot of hostility in order to get their question answered.

To be fair, this sort of thing doesn't just play out on StackOverflow, I've also seen it play out in the workplace, especially as a junior developer in my first job. I learned pretty quickly that the best thing I could do was to try and solve my own problems and only reach out for help if I had exhausted all other options.

However, being an autodidact, in my opinion, is the only way to really show value as technology changes so rapidly and the breadth of knowledge required to be a good developer is just too much to only rely on formal education, seminars, conferences, or workshops to stay relevant.

Also, most questions haven't been explicitly answered anywhere else, even on a crowdsourced site like StackOverflow. You often need to just read the docs and experiment with things yourself.

What's really exciting to me is that AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude are making this whole process much better. They've added a whole dimension to the process by making learning online more like a dialogue instead of a one way lecture.

But, there are still some improvements that I'd like to see. Transformers are great at predicting the next sequence of text based on some input. So it's great at answering questions that you have. But when you're just starting out, you don't know what questions to ask.

Another aspect of the learning process that's missing is the ability to experiment, and through trial and error, answer your own questions.

I think this an opportunity for AI to really help. You could have expert teachers create a list of prompts to ask an LLM in a specific domain a sequence resembling a syllabus. Each module could then generate a set of excercises to complete allowing for experimentation.

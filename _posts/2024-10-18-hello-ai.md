Seems to me that AI or more specifically GenAI has caught the business world by storm ever since ChatGPT 3.5 was released in late 2022.

I've been following it pretty closely, using LLMs heavily in my day-to-day work as an developer, mostly as a replacement for StackOverflow. RIP btw.

Recently, I've been experimenting with using different prompts to get different sorts of responses out of ChatGPT4o. For example, assigning expert roles to the LLM is pretty cool.

But, I'm really interested in what sorts of tasks of economic value I can get it to do that are possible now but weren't possible in the not-so-distant past.

The dream of any geek like myself is to build a business that generates $$$ while I sleep. To do that, you need something that will earn ad-revenue, online sales, or rent.

Of course this was possible before GenAI with software, but the market has been really saturated with mobile Apps and well established SaaS.
